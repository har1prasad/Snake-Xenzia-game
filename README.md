### Project: **Snake Xenzia Game**

**Description:**

The Snake Xenzia Game is a classic arcade game implemented using Python's Turtle module. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, aiming to eat food and grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries. Features include increasing difficulty as the snake grows, score tracking, and simple, intuitive controls. This project is perfect for practicing basic game development concepts and understanding event-driven programming in Python.

**Implementation**

Implemented for learning purposes in an object-oriented programming (OOP) way using Python's Turtle module. The project follows this order:

1. Created the snake body
2. Moved the snake body
3. Controlled the snake body
4. Detected collision with food
5. Created a scoreboard
6. Detected collision with the wall
7. Detected collision with the tail

Try to solve these smaller units of the problem by reading the [Turtle module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) and experimenting.
